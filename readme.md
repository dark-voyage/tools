## About

In this repository I keep all tools that I use on my daily coding journey. Sometimes, those scripts make my life easier, sometimes tougher.
Depends on the case. I have many scripts for various environments, like... linux, macos and windows. This project is automatically cloned
when you install my dotfiles.

> Everytime I installed my dev env manually by myself, I started feeling like a garbage myself... So here you are!

## Features (*nix means both macos and linux)

- brew packages listing (macos)
- dev-cleaner (*nix)
- fast-push (*nix)
- github-location (*nix)
- google (*nix)
- sudo mode (windows)

## Install

Just clone the repository and add the root directory of repository to your $PATH variable.

```bash
